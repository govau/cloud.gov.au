abstract: Whenever there is an incident, we run a Post Incident Reports to learn about what happened and what we can do differently.

We take the performance of our platform seriously. While we rely on our suppliers to provide software and infrastructure to deliver cloud.gov.au, we own our availability and we take full responsibility for service performance.

We run Post Incident Reports because we believe there is valuable information to be learnt from failures, which we can use to improve the systems, tools, and processes that power cloud.gov.au.
