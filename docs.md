## The platform for building the future

cloud.gov.au is a place to run web apps, freeing up teams to focus on writing code that meets user needs. It provides a faster, safer, standard way to change web apps without impacting the user. It also provides real-time visibility and insight into web app usage, performance, and behaviour.

Combined, **this makes it easy for government to release, monitor and grow user-facing digital services.**

## Industry standard technology, best-practice approach

cloud.gov.au is built with the industry leading Platform as a Service (PaaS) technology [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/), running on top of [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) in the Sydney region.

To help teams release changes faster and more safely, all changes to production are done through a fully automated Continuous Delivery pipeline:

> Myth: Organisations must choose between speed and reliability.
>
> Fact: High-performing IT organizations deploy 30x more frequently, with 200x shorter lead times; they have 60x fewer failures and recover 168x faster.
>
